# QueueSystem

A queue system designed to help budy teachers give help to their students. This is acheived through peer networking through my [Custom PeerJS Server](https://github.com/TheeeEVan/QueueSystemServer) that is hosted on heroku. It is meant to be simplistic and easy to use, while very effective.

## Libraries used
- [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/)
- [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/)
